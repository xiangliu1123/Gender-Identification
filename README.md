Identify the gender of a given person from his/her face images. You will be
given a face dataset. You will have to extract features from the data, deploy the classifiers (using
Scikit-learn/Matlab/Octave/R/your preferred programming language), and finally measure the
performances (in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall rate) of the classifier. You need to
experiment with the following classifiers:
I. K-Nearest Neighbors
II. Artificial Neural Network
III. Na√Øve Bayes
IV. Logistic Regression
